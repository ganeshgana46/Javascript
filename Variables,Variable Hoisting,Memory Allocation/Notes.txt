Variables :
    
    A name given to the memory location and it is used to store the data.

      var m ; //declaration
      console.log(m);
      m =200; //intialization
      console.log(m);


Variables are Containers for Storing Data

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const


There are two types of Variables :

1.Local Variables :

Any variable that is created inside a function is known as
local variable.

>>Local variable can be accessed with in the funtion only.They are
  called as local variables just because, these variables are specific
  to that function and can be visible only with in that function.

eg1 : 

<script>
  function f1(){
            var a = 10;//LC
            var b = 20;//LC
            var c = 30;//LC

            console.log(a);
            console.log(b);
            console.log(c);
          }
          f1();
          console.log(a);//undefined
</script>


2.Global Variables :

Any Variable which we create outside any functions or blocks is known as global variable.

>>Global Variables can be accessed any where.....

eg1 :

<script>
        var a = 100; //GV
        var b = 200; //GV

        console.log(a); //100
        console.log(b); //200

        function f1(){
            console.log(a); //100
            a = 900;
        }
        function f2(){
            console.log(b); //200
        }
        f1();
        f2();
        console.log(a); //900

</script>

eg2 :

<script>
     var a = 100;
        function f1(){
            var a = 0;
            console.log(a); //0
            a = 900;
            console.log(a); //900
        }
        f1();
        console.log(a); //100
</script>

eg3 :

<script>
     var a = 100;
        function f1(){
            a = 0;
            console.log(a); //0
            a = 900;
            console.log(a); //900
        }
        f1();
        console.log(a); //900
</script>

Variable Hoisting :

It is a default process that happen in JS before the exceution
of the code.

Variable Hoisting is the process where all teh local variables,global
variables are declared at the top before the execution of the code


var a = 10;
function f1(){
    console.log(a);
    var a = 900;
}
f1();

process : variable Hoisting
 
/*
   var a; //undefined
   a =10; //10
   function f1(){
    var a; //undefined
    console.log(a); //undefined
    a = 900; 
   }
   f1();
*/
