Closures :

closure is a scope that get formed when a function created inside another function...

Note : JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope.
       Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.

function f1(){

    function f2(){  // Closure scope

    }

}

A function inside another function is known as nested function / inner function.
If we want to create private methods then we use nested functions.

<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            function outer(){
                var a = 10, b = 20;
                function inner(){
                    console.log(a);
                    console.log(b);
                }
                inner();
            }
            outer();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
